* Example Nix + Haskell + Tensorflow project

This project is an example of how to use Nix package manager to build Haskell
package which uses Tensorflow.

The skeleton of the repository layout and most of the Nix expressions are taken
from the rather excellent Nix + Haskell example projct by Sukant Hajra
https://github.com/shajra/example-nix
